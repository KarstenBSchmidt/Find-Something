# Find Something

This CSS 481 Web Programming And Applications project was developed by Karsten Schmidt, Jac Chambers, Cole Weber and Kerry Thornock.

This application finds places to bike to, walk to or see around you. This is displayed on a map, which draws your route. 

## Setup
To setup this project, you must first establish a Firebase project with Firestore and Authentication by email and password enabled.

Then, download the directory: 
```
npm i
```
> If not working, sometimes you have to individually run these two commands:
> ```
> npm i firebase 
> npm run dev
> ```
This allows you to see the site in developer mode.

# ENJOY! :)
